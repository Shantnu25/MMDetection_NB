# MMDetection_NB

This repository contains IPython Notebooks for Computer Vision tasks using MMDetection on Google Colab. 

MMDetection is an open source object detection and instance segmentation toolbox based on PyTorch. 
There are numerous methods available for object detection and instance segmentation collected from various well-acclaimed models. 
It enables quick training and inferencIt is a part of the OpenMMLab project. 
OpenMMLab covers a wide range of research topics of computer vision, e.g., classification, detection, segmentation and super-resolution.e with quality.

MMDetection is an amazing toolbox but with less resources and tutorials available online, which can be a problem for new users.

This is a small attempt to reduce complexities, make it easy to understand, experiment and implement various CV tasks.
