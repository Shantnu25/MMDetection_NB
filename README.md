# OpenMMLab_NB

This repository contains IPython Notebooks for Computer Vision tasks using OpenMMLab - MMDetection, MMSegemntation etc. 

OpenMMLab covers a wide range of research topics of computer vision, e.g., classification, detection, segmentation and super-resolution.e with quality.

OpenMMLab is an amazing toolbox with good tutorials, there are less resources and articles available online, but to implement many functionalities we require GPUs, extensice document reading or installation, which can be a problem for new users.

This is a small attempt to reduce complexities, make it easy to understand, experiment and implement various CV tasks using OpenMMLab's various tools - MMDetection, MMSegemntation etc.
